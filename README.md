# Technologies Used
 * HTML
 The structure and content of the web page is builded using HTML.

 * CSS
 I have used CSS for style and layout of the web application.

 * JavaScript
 I have used JavaScript for logic and interactivity of the web application page.

 * API (API Link: https://gis.ducks.org/datasets/du-university-chapters/api)
 This API uses ArcGIS REST services that enables the use of mapping capabilities through a web based interface. The ArcGIS REST services functionalities and capabilities such as geocoding services allowed provision for locating addresses on a map. This gives the state and city that the university is located at.
